      <p> Debating in school is a sure-shot way of making your child an accomplished orator. The skills that a child picks up while debating will be of great help to him not just in his career but also in his everyday interactions. 
        So encourage him to debate often and watch as he grows up to be a confident and coherent adult.</p>
